## 1. Introduction

**What is it?**

- IPsec is not a single protocol, but a framework for securing IP traffic
- It is primarily designed to protect unicast traffic in point-to-point VPNs
- IPsec establishes a secure control channel first - Phase 1, then negotiates data-protecting channel - Pahse 2
- The control channel is used only for key management and crypto parametres negotioation for data channel
- User data is protected separately using Data channel
- All communications inside both tunnels are encrypted and authenticated
- Routing protocols that rely on multicast or broadcast (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP) cannot run directly over classic IPsec tunnels
- To support such protocols, a GRE tunnel is built first, and IPsec is used to encrypt the GRE traffic
 Process of building a first tunnel is called Phase 1
- IPSec consists of 3 protocols:
    - ESP - data plane
    - AH(obsolete) - data plane
    - IKE v1 or v2 - control plane

**Why it was invented?**

- To add security to IP networking itself
- Original Internet had no built-in security
- IP provides no: Encryption, Authentication, Integrity protection, Anti-replay protection
- Anyone on the path could: Read packets, Modify packets, Spoof IP addresses, Inject traffic
- Security at higher layers was not enough: Every application had to implement its own security, traffic like routing, management, or custom protocols remained exposed
- IPsec enabled: Site-to-site VPNs, Remote-access VPNs, Secure inter-datacenter links

**Who and when invented it?**

- Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 1995
- 1996–1998 - BSD Linux Implementations
- Late 1990s – early 2000s: Cisco, Checkpoint, Juniper

**IPSec goals**

- Mutual authentication of peers
- Secure key establishment
- Negotiation of security parameters
- Creation and management of Security Associations
- Data encryption - confidentiality
- Data integrity - data is not modified
- Authentication of packet origin - Verify that packets truly come from the expected peer - Cryptographic authentication per packet
- Anti-replay protection
- Traffic protection policy enforcement - Define which traffic is protected and how
- Secure transport over untrusted networks

**Terms**  
  
IPSec has several new terms, which are used everywhere in protocol descriptions. These terms are:

- SPI
- Transform set
- SA

Below is their meaning and description

## 2. SPI

- SPI stands for `Security Parameters Index`
- 32-bit identifier(number) used to identify a specific Security Association (SA) in IPsec
- This number is injected into the header of  every ESP/AH/IKE packet, so the remote peer knows which Security Assosiation (SA) `[cryptographic parametres and keys]` to use for decryption and authentication
- Also these numbers (for both local and remote peer) are stored in router's memory for Phase 1 and Phase 2 Security Assosiations 
- It is used in both phases during tunnels establishment and in both tunnels: data and control
- Each peer generates its own SPI and sends to peer during Tunnel 1 creation and Tunnel 2 creation, and it means that the peer wants to receive traffic, using this SPI
- Different SPIs for different tunnels are generated
- The SPI is never reused between peers
- `Outbound SPI` - The SPI my router inserts into ESP/AH/IKE  I send
- `Inbound SPI` - The SPI my router expects to see in ESP/IKE/AH packets I receive

**Phase 1 and Phase 2 SPIs**

- Phase 1 tunnel SA is uniquely identified by 2 SPIs in router's logical object: local SPI and remote SPI
- Phase 2 tunnel SA is uniquely identified by `1 SPI`, but at the same time there are `2 SAs` in routers memory for each Phase 2 tunnel: `Inbound SA and Outbound SA`
- The ESP/AH header in data packets uses the Phase 2 SPI as the first field to indicate which SA/key to use
- For every new Phase 2 tunnel - because of different traffic selectors - new pairs of SPI are generated by both sides

## 3. SA

- SA - Security association - `has 2 meanings`
    - Meaning 1 - it is a set of cryptographic options that are negotiated between devices that are establishing an IPSec relationship
    - Meaning 2 - it is a logical object stored and tracked by the device (router/firewall)
- SAs are used in both meanings in both Phases of IKE protocol
- Phase 1 and Phase 2 of IKE negotioations have different SAs
- Each IPSec connection to 1 peer has minimum 3 SAs in router's memory: 1 SA for Phase 1 tunnel (bidectional, used for inbound and outbound traffic) and 2 SAs for Phase 2 tunnel: one for Inbound traffic and one for Outbound
- Each IPSec connection to a peer may have more than 2 Phase 2 SAs, it depends on the amount of traffic selectors, for each traffic selector another pair of SAs for Phase 2 is created

### 3.1 Phase 1 - IKE SA

**As a set of options**

- SA, used during Phase 1, is called IKE SA and it is `Bidirectional`: used for protecting control traffic in both directions 
- IKE SA as a set of cryptographic options consist of `SPIs(initiator and responder) and Proposals` - this is what we see in a packet
- `Proposal` consists of `Transforms`
- Transforms maybe be different types: `Encryption, Hash, Authentication Method, DH group, Lifetime`
- `Authentication method is not negotiated as a transform in IKEv2` - it’s implicit in the IKE_AUTH exchange
- The `set of transforms` inside one proposal defines the full Phase 1 policy - `transform set`
- Example on how SA looks like on the wire during phase 1 IKE v1::

**Logical structure**

**Example of SA phase 1 IKEv1 as a logical object**  

On router via Cisco command `show crypto isakmp sa detail` - It displays IKEv1 Phase 1 Security Associations currently known to the router

```
IPv4 Crypto ISAKMP SA
dst             src             state          conn-id status
192.0.2.2       192.0.2.1       QM_IDLE        1001    ACTIVE

     IKE SA details:
       Session-id: 1001
       Status: ACTIVE
       IKE version: 1
       Exchange type: Main Mode
       Authentication method: Pre-Shared Key
       Encryption: AES-CBC
       Hashing: SHA1
       DH group: 2
       Lifetime: 86400 seconds

```

### 3.2 Phase 2 - IPSec SA 

**As a set of options during negotiations**

- Each SA payload contains one or more Proposals
- Each Proposal has:
    - Protocol ID (ESP = 50, AH = 51)
    - SPI Size (usually 4 bytes)
    - SPI Value (the actual 32-bit number)
    - Transform set, consisting of several transforms: encryption, auth(Integrity, HMAC), lifetime, DH group - no Authentication method, like in Phase 1

**As a logical object on a router**

- SA, used during Phase 2, is called IPSec SA and it is Unidirectional: used for protecting Data traffic in one direction, so 2 SAs are required for communication
- SA is uniquely identified by a Security Parameter Index (SPI), an IPv4 or IPv6 destination address, and a security protocol (AH or ESP) identifier 
- Outbound and inbound SAs are differenti
- Inbound SA for Phase 2: how to decrypt and authenticate packets arriving at the device based on SPI inside ESP protocol
- Outbound SA for Phase 2: How to encrypt and authenticate packets leaving the device based on SPI inside ESP protocol
- `Both SAs (inbound and outbound) use the same crypto parameters, negotiated during Phase 2`
- `But the keys are different for each direction`
- `Each SA has its own SPI` - Inbound SA has a SPI of remote peer, what it expects to see in an incoming packet - Outbound SPI has an SPI of local router and is used when sending packets to remote router
- Any time direction, keying material, protocol, or traffic selectors differ → a separate SA is required

**Phase 2 — two SA objects** 

```
IPsec SA (outbound)
├── SPI: 0x1001
├── Encryption key
├── Integrity key
└── Traffic selector

IPsec SA (inbound)
├── SPI: 0x2002
├── Encryption key
├── Integrity key
└── Traffic selector
```

### 3.3 Manual and Dynamic SAs

**Manual SA**

- Manual SAs require no negotiation; all values, including the keys, are static and specified in the configuration
- If you configure static/manual IPsec SAs, you do not need (and cannot use) IKE
- All parameters are manually configured on both sides:
    - SPI (Security Parameter Index)
    - Encryption & authentication algorithms
    - Keys
    - Peer IPs
    - Lifetimes (if any)
- There is no key negotiation, rekeying, or authentication exchange
- Used only in test setups or simple, static environments
- Drawback: keys must be changed manually — no automatic refresh → insecure and unscalable 

**Dynamic SA**

- Dynamic SAs require additional configuration. With dynamic SAs, you configure IKE first and then the SA. IKE creates dynamic security associations; it negotiates SAs for IPsec and IKE
- The IKE configuration defines the algorithms and keys used to establish the secure IKE connection with the peer security gateway
- This connection is then used to dynamically agree upon keys and other data used by the dynamic IPsec SA. The IKE SA is negotiated first and then used to protect the negotiations that determine the dynamic IPsec SAs

## 4. Transform set

- A transform set is a combination of one or more transforms used to build an IPsec Security Association (SA) during Phase 2 (Quick Mode / Child SA) negotiation or IKE Security Assosiation during Phase 1
- Each transform describes one specific aspect of how IPsec protects the traffic
- Transform types:
    - Encryption Algorithm (ENCR) - AES-CBC, AES-GCM, 3DES, ChaCha20-Poly1305
    - Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) - In IKEv1, PRF is not a separate transform — it’s implicit in Phase 1 - PRF-HMAC-SHA1, PRF-HMAC-SHA256
    - Integrity / Authentication Algorithm (INTEG) - HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA256, AES-XCBC
    - Diffie-Hellman Group (D-H Group) - Defines key exchange strength (PFS in Phase 2) - MODP-2048 (Group 14), ECP-256 (Group 19)
- ESP transform set includes encryption + integrity
- AH - integrity only  

## 5. Traffic Selectors/Proxy IDs

- These are parametres, used during negotiations during Phase 2
- In Palo Alto terms it is called Proxy ID
- Traffic selector consist of local network, remote network, protocol, port - they should match on both sides
- They are configured manually on aech node
- It is not used very often now, because mostly route based IPSec is uased instead of Policy based
- They are sent separatly outside the SA
- Their goal is to specify which traffic should be sent to the IPSec tunnel in Policy based IPSec implementations

**Example of logic**

```
Node A sends 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0 TCP Any port > 192.168.2.2/255.255.255.255 TCP 443 port
Node B sends 192.168.2.2/255.255.255.255 TCP 443 > 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0 TCP Any port
This configuration allows traffic from 192.168.1.0/24 to 192.168.2.2 port 443
```

- Some vendors allow “any-to-any” traffic without strict traffic selectors, meaning the SA could match all traffic between the peers’ IPs
- For route based VPN TS are set to 0.0.0.0 - which means "any traffic is allowed"

**Example of traffic selectors in IPSec SA for Cisco Router**

```

        replay detection support: Y
        Status: ACTIVE
```

## 6. IKE v1

- IKEv1 was designed by the IETF IPsec work group in the mid-1990s and standardized in 1998 as RFC 2409
- First appeared in Research & open-source Unix IPsec stacks, then in Cisco IOS, Checkpoint, Juniper
- IKE v1 goals: 
    - Authenticate peers
    - Negotiate cryptographic parameters
    - Establish shared secret keys
    - Create and manage IPsec Security Associations (SAs)
    - Provide Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
    - Detect peer liveness
    - Provides identity protection (in main mode)
- IKE v1 uses UDP port 500 or UDP port 4500 in case of NAT-T technology
- IKEv1 uses two phases to authenticate peers once and securely negotiate traffic protection many times
- Phase 1 — Build a secure control channel
- Phase 2 - negotiate parametres for Data traffic encryption via secure Control Channel
- Phase 1 can work in 2 modes: main and aggressive
- 9 messages in total if main mode is used in Phase 1
- 6 messages in total if aggressive mode is used in Phase 1
- IKEv1 was developed, combining ideas from three earlier protocols:
    - ISAKMP – framework for messages and SA management, how packets are formatted (headers, payload types), a generic state machine for SA negotiation, but not how keys are exchanged
    - Oakley – Diffie-Hellman key exchange and math, key derivation techniques, DH groups
    - SKEME – identity protection, rekeying, multiple SAs, negotiate algorithms, separation of key exchange from authentication, multiple authentication styles
- There is IKE traffic, when everything is established and data flows normally - keepalives via port UDP/500, if NAT-T is enabled then UDP/4500 is used
- In the IPsec/IKE world, the “initiator” is the peer that first sends an IKE packet to start the negotiation
- The responder replies. This role is independent of who sends actual data over ESP later
- PFS in IKEv1 = `Perform a new DH exchange during Phase 2`. It does not mean “ephemeral DH” in the modern TLS sense

### 6.1 Workflow

- IKE Phase 1 — Establish a secure channel (IKE SA) - starts with UDP/500, may switch to UDP/4500
    - `Main mode` - 6 messages
    - `Aggressive mode` - 3 messages
    - SA negotiation - Agree on crypto parametres - transform sets
    - DH key exchange
    - Authentication - encrypted already
    - NAT-T negotiation
    - IKE SA - one for inbound and outbound - IKE SA is bidirectional
    - Local SPI → The SPI that your router uses when sending ISAKMP messages
    - Remote SPI → The SPI your router expects in incoming ISAKMP messages from the peer
- XAuth
- Config mode
- IKE Phase 2 — Negotiate IPsec SAs (ESP or AH) - `Quick mode` - UDP/500 or UDP4500
    - Negotiate 2 IPsec SAs - inbound and outbound - crypto parametres the same - keys are different
    - Exchange traffic selectors (Proxy-ID) - should be the same
    - `Outbound SPI` - The SPI my router inserts into ESP packets I send
    - `Inbound SPI` - The SPI my router expects to see in ESP packets I receive
    - Transform sets - negotiate crypto paramtres
- ESP/AH encapsulation — Actual data traffic encryption/authentication using the negotiated keys - IP/50(ESP) or UDP/4500 or IP/51(AH) - Destination SPI is in header

### 6.2 Phase 1

**Concepts**

- During traffic capture you cannot see Phase 2 negotiation, only Phase 1 as ISAKMP protocol, everything else is encrypted
- Phase 1 SA is called ISAKMP SA or IKE SA
- The Phase 1 keys are long-lived and tied to identity/authentication
- IKE SA and IPSec SAs must be cryptographically independent
- Phase 1 establishes an ISAKMP(Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol) SA, which is a secure channel through which the IPsec SA negotiation can take place
- Phase 1 workflow: `Crypto negotiations > DH exchange > Authentication > IKE communications between routers `
- The ISAKMP header has its own SPI pair
- These SPIs identify the IKE SA
- IKE SA is bidirectional

**Negotiations - The following crypto parametres are negotiated during Phase 1**

- Hashing - md5 or sha - used inside HMAC for authentication and integrity of every IKE packet
- Authentication - Preshared Keys or certificates
- Group - Diffie Helman group - algorithm which is used to establish shared secret keys
- Encryption
- Lifetime - 24 hours default - don't have to match  
   
To easy remember this we can use first letters of these parametres: `HAGEL`

**IKE Phase 1 can be established via**

- main mode(6 messages)  
- aggressive mode(3 messages) 

**IKE identity**

- If you do not configure a local-identity, the device uses the IPv4 or IPv6 address corresponding to the local endpoint by default
- It can be: distinguished-name, hostname, ip-address, e-mail-address, key-id
- Configurated on most devices, maybe none, on every device we configure both local and remote ID - on Palo Alto it is configured in IKE gateway
- It must match the peer’s expectations

**Main Mode**

- At the cost of three extra messages, Main Mode provides identity protection, enabling the peers to hide their actual identities from potential attackers. This means that the peers’ identities are never exchanged unencrypted in the course of the IKE negotiation
- In main mode, the initiator and recipient send three two-way exchanges (six messages total) to accomplish the following services:
- `First exchange` (messages 1 and 2) — `Proposes and accepts the encryption and authentication algorithms`
- `Second exchange` (messages 3 and 4) — `Executes a DH exchange, and the initiator and recipient each provide a pseudorandom number`
- `Third exchange` (messages 5 and 6) — `Sends and verifies the identities of the initiator and recipient - authentication is here via PSK` - `Each side now proves knowledge of the PSK without sending it` - Both nodes computes a hash based on PSK and many other parametres
- The information transmitted in the third exchange of messages is protected by the encryption algorithm established in the first two exchanges. Thus, the participants’ identities are encrypted and therefore not transmitted “in the clear.”

**Aggressive mode**

- In aggressive mode, the initiator and recipient accomplish the same objectives as with main mode, but in only two exchanges, with a total of three messages:
- First message — The initiator proposes the security association (SA), initiates a DH exchange, and sends a pseudorandom number and its IKE identity. When configuring aggressive mode with multiple proposals for Phase 1 negotiations, use the same DH group in all proposals because the DH group cannot be negotiated. Up to four proposals can be configured. Message one contains everything that was in messages 1,3,5 in Main mode.
- Second message — The recipient accepts the SA; authenticates the initiator; and sends a pseudorandom number, its IKE identity, and, if using certificates, the recipient's certificate. It contains the same as messages 2,4,6 in Main mode
- Third message — The initiator authenticates the recipient, confirms the exchange, and, if using certificates, sends the initiator's certificate
- Because the participants’ identities are exchanged in the clear (in the first two messages), aggressive mode does not provide identity protection
- Main and aggressive modes applies only to IKEv1 protocol. IKEv2 protocol does not negotiate using main and aggressive modes

### 6.3 Phase 2

- There is only one mode - `quick` in Phase 2, `3 packets`
- By default, Phase 2 keys are derived from the session key created in Phase 1. Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
forces a new Diffie-Hellman exchange when the tunnel starts and whenever the Phase 2 keylife expires, causing
a new key to be generated each time. This exchange ensures that the keys created in Phase 2 are unrelated to
the Phase 1 keys or any other keys generated automatically in Phase 2
- PFS does not mean “ephemeral DH” in the modern TLS sense

**Cisco IOS example**

```
crypto map VPN 10 ipsec-isakmp
 set pfs group14
```

- Phase 2 (Quick Mode) packets are sent inside the encrypted IKE SA
- In your packet capture you will still see UDP 500 (or UDP 4500 if NAT-T) packets
- But their payloads are encrypted — they look like random binary blobs
- You can no longer see SA proposals, proxy-IDs, algorithms, etc

**Phase 2 has 3 packets only**

```
Initiator → Responder : SA, Nonce, traffic selectors, SPI, key exchange - optional
Responder → Initiator : SA, Nonce, SPI, key exchange - optional
Initiator → Responder : HASH (ack)
```

- No authentication happens during Phase 2
- Responder does not send Traffic Selectors, it just agrees or declines Traffic Selectors from initiator

**Example of first packet**

**Negotiated options list - what is negotiated during Phase 2**

- Protocol: ESP or AH
- Mode: Tunnel or Transport
- Encryption transform: AES-CBC-256 - If AEAD (e.g., AES-GCM) was chosen in the encryption transform, separate integrity transform is not needed
- Integrity transform: HMAC-SHA1-96
- Lifetime: 3600 seconds and 4608000 kilobytes
- PFS: group 14 (if requested)
- Traffic Selectors(Proxy ID): 10.0.0.0/24 <-> 192.168.0.0/24 (proto any)
- Responder SPI (e.g. 0x3f2a1b4c) and Initiator SPI (e.g. 0x9a7e6c2d) — assigned by peers
- ESN: enabled (if negotiated / supported) - ESN = Extended Sequence Numbers - ESN extends the ESP sequence number from 32 bits to 64 bits

**To confirm Phase 2 happened, look for**

- Three small encrypted IKEv1 packets right after Phase 1
- ESP traffic starting immediately after them
- UDP/500 or 4500

### Xauth - Extended Authentication - replaced by IKEv2

- XAuth (Extended Authentication) is an optional extra authentication step used only with IKEv1, mainly to authenticate individual users (not just devices)
- XAuth is an extension to IKEv1 Phase 1, and it happens after Phase 1 but before Phase 2
- Standard IKEv1 Phase 1 authenticates devices or gateways (via PSK or certificates)
- XAuth adds a user-level authentication step — typically username and password
- Peers complete Phase 1 (Main Mode) → a secure channel (IKE SA) is established
- The responder (gateway) requests XAuth credentials from the initiator
- The initiator (client) provides username and password
- The gateway validates them (e.g., against local DB, RADIUS, LDAP, etc.)
- If successful → proceed to Phase 2 (Quick Mode) to negotiate IPsec SAs
- IKEv2 replaced XAuth with EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) for user-level auth

### Mode-Config Phase

- Assign IP, DNS, WINS, Split tunnel
- Happens after XAuth
- Not used in IKEv2
- In IKEv2 it is called Configuration Payloads (CP) inside the IKE_AUTH exchange

## NAT-T

```
+----------------+-----------+-------------+------------+------------------------+---------+-------------+----------+
|  New IP header | UDP header| NAT-T header| ESP header |Original Inner IP Header| IP Data | ESP trailer | ESP auth |
|    20 bytes    |  8 bytes  |   4 bytes   |  8 bytes   |                        |         |   2 bytes   | 12 bytes |
+----------------+-----------+-------------+------------+------------------------+---------+-------------+----------+
```

- ESP breaks when NAT is present
- ESP Tunnel Mode does not include the outer IP header in its Integrity Check Value (ICV)
- ESP Tunnel Mode protects: ESP header, Inner IP header, Payload, `It does NOT include the outer IP header`
- So if NAT changes the outer source/destination IP, `the ICV is not affected`
- `NAT cannot translate ESP because ESP has no ports` - NAT cannot track the flow
- `NAT breaks IPsec because IPsec expects stable src/dst IPs` - Even if ESP ICV survives, the security association itself is bound to a pair of IP addresses
- When NAT-T is enabled, `only SPI` is used for SA lookup
- Without NAT-T `SPI + IPs` are used for SA lookup
- UDP port 4500
- Total overhead - 54 bytes!
- Peers detect NAT-Traversal (NAT-T) automatically using a built-in mechanism in IKE phase 1 (IKEv1 Main Mode or IKEv2 IKE_SA_INIT)
- Each peer sends two special hashes: HASH(Original Source IP, Source Port), HASH(Original Destination IP, Destination Port)
- Each peer receives the other’s NAT-D payloads and compares them to what the packet actually arrived with
- The hashes match → no NAT
- By enabling this option, IPSec traffic can pass through a NAT device
- If the peers detect NAT in the path, they switch to: UDP/4500 for IKE, ESP-in-UDP/4500 for data
- Both peers must explicitly signal support for NAT-Traversal during Phase 1

The steps are:

- Announce NAT-T support
- Exchange NAT-D hashes
- Detect NAT (if hashes mismatch)
- Switch to UDP/4500

If only ONE peer supports NAT-T

- NAT-T = disabled
- Traffic stays UDP/500 + ESP
- Tunnel will fail if a real NAT is present

## IKEv2

- Supports EAP
- Anti-DDOS
- Fewer messages to establish IKE and IPSEC SAs: 4, instead of 6 or 9 in IKEv1
- IKEv2 removed ISAKMP entirely and defined its own message format
- Consist of request/response  pairs, called exchages: IKE_SA_INIT, IKE_AUTH, 
- In IKEv2 there is no Main Mode or Aggressive Mode
- Total: 4 messages if no EAP. More if EAP
- IKEv2 has:
    - IKE SPI (for both IKE_SA_INIT and IKE_AUTH)
    - ESP/AH SPI for CHILD_SA (used only in ESP/AH traffic)
- IKEv2 does not have phase 2
- One child Ipsec SA is created by default in IKE_AUTH message
- If you need additional Child SA - 2 more messages - request and response
- Functionally, Phase 2 in IKEv1 (Quick Mode) and IKEv2 (Child SA) both negotiate ESP/AH SAs, keys, lifetimes, and traffic selectors, optionally with PFS
- IKEv2 merges and simplifies the process, reduces message count, enforces explicit traffic selectors, and has cleaner rekey/Child SA creation flows
- Traffic selectors are Mandatory: you must specify the exact local and remote subnets or hosts that this Child SA will cover
- Workarounds for “any-to-any” for route based VPN: Cover all relevant subnets with broad TS + Use the VTI to route all traffic through a single IPsec SA
- IKEv2 replaced XAuth with EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) for user-level auth - carried inside IKE_AUTH
- In IKEv2 Mode-Config phase is called Configuration Payloads (CP) inside the IKE_AUTH exchange
- Next generation encryption support: AES-GCM, ECDH, etc...
- Assymetric authentication: one cert and other password

In a Nutshell - 4 mandatory messages only

```
Initiator > IKE_SA_INIT > Responder
Responder > IKE_SA_INIT reply > Initiator - IKE SA done
Initiator > IKE_AUTH > Responder - Encrypted - possible Configuration Payloads (CP)
Responder > IKE_AUTH reply > Initiator - IPSEC SA done - possible Configuration Payloads (CP)
EAP packets - Optional - carried inside IKE_AUTH
Initiator > CREATE_CHILD_SA > Responder - Optional
Responder > CREATE_CHILD_SA > Initiator - Optional
```

- Initiator sends IKE_SA_INIT packet: it contains Security assosiations wuth proposals: Encryption, Integrity, DH group + Key Exchange + Nonce + Initiator SPI

```
Internet Key Exchange Version 2
  Initiator SPI:  a1b2c3d4e5f60708
  Responder SPI:  0000000000000000
  Next payload:   SA
  Exchange type:  IKE_SA_INIT (34)
  Flags:          Initiator

  Payload: Security Association
    Proposal #1: ESP + IKE transforms
      Encryption: AES-CBC-256
      Integrity : SHA256
      DH group  : 14 (2048-bit MODP)
  Payload: Key Exchange
    DH Group: 14
    KEi: <256 bytes of DH>
  Payload: Nonce (Ni)
    Ni: <random 32 bytes>
```

- Responder sends  IKE_SA_INIT packet as well: chosen proposal, DH public part, Nonce, Cookie if AntiDDoS is used + Initiator, Responder SPI

```
Internet Key Exchange Version 2
  Initiator SPI:  a1b2c3d4e5f60708
  Responder SPI:  1122334455667788
  Next payload:   SA
  Exchange type:  IKE_SA_INIT (34)
  Flags:          Response

  Payload: Security Association
    Selected Proposal:
      Encryption: AES-CBC-256
      Integrity : SHA256
      DH group  : 14

  Payload: Key Exchange
    KEr: <256 bytes of DH>
  Payload: Nonce (Nr)
    Nr: <random 32 bytes>

  OPTIONAL:
  Payload: Cookie (if DoS-protection active)
```

- Initiator sends IKE_AUTH - Encrypted! - ID, SPIs, Auth type, ESP proposal(to create IPSEC SA, the same what is done in Phase 2 in IKEv1), traffic selectors

```
Internet Key Exchange Version 2
  Initiator SPI:  a1b2c3d4e5f60708
  Responder SPI:  1122334455667788
  Next payload:   Encrypted
  Exchange type:  IKE_AUTH (35)
  Flags:          Initiator, Encrypted

  Encrypted payload contents:
    IDi             → "CN=vpn-client.example.com"
    AUTH            → HMAC or RSA signature
    SA (for CHILD_SA)
      ESP proposal (AES-GCM-128, no integrity)
    TSi             → 192.168.10.0/24
    TSr             → 10.10.10.0/24
```

- Responder sends sends IKE_AUTH - Encrypted! - SPIs, ID, Auth, ESP proposal accepted, traffic selectors

## ESP

- Separate IP protocol for Data Plane
- Confidentiality, authentication, replay protection
- IP protocol number 50
- Supports encryption and NAT-T
- ESP mode: tunnel or transport mode
- Transport mode - adds ESP header after original IP header + ESP trailer + ESP auth
- Transport mode is practically never used, only when 2 firewalls communicate only with each other
- Tunnel mode - encrypts the entire original packet - adds a new set of IP headers
- Required parametres for Tunnel mode:
    - Symmetric cipher
    - Hash
    - DH group
    - Lifetime

**Data flow in practice**

- Router receives an ESP packet
- Reads SPI from the ESP header
- Looks up SAD to find:
    - Encryption key
    - Integrity key
    - Mode, lifetime, etc.
- Verifies ICV (if authentication is used)
- Decrypts payload only using the key

## Authentication Header

- Separate protocol above IP with encapsulation for data plane
- Data Integrity, Authentication, Protection from replays
- IP 51
- Does not support encryption
- Does not support NAT-T
- Transorm set for authentication header defines only HMAC function, for example `ah-sha-hmac`

## Configuration - Cisco

Three possible ways to configure IPSec tunnel on Cisco Routers:

- Pure (Policy-Based) IPsec - crypto-map–based IPsec
    - Traffic is matched by crypto ACLs
    - No tunnel interface
    - IPSec is applied directly to the physical interface via a crypto map
    - Routing is not aware of the tunnel
    - No dynamic routing protocols
- IPsec + VTI (Virtual Tunnel Interface) - route-based IPsec
    - A logical Tunnel interface is created
    - IPSec protects the tunnel traffic
    - Routing happens over the tunnel
    - Tunnel Interface
                    └── IPSec Profile
    - Supports dynamic routing
- IPsec with GRE (GRE over IPsec) - A tunnel inside a tunnel
    - GRE provides encapsulation
    - `Can be done both with crypto maps and IPSec profile` 
    - IPSec encrypts the GRE packets
    - GRE handles routing, MULTICAST, multiple subnets
    - Can be policy-based or route-based
    - `Use only when multicast is required`
- A VTI-based (route-based) IPsec endpoint and a policy-based (crypto-map) endpoint are architecturally incompatible
- Policy-based IPsec Expects specific proxy IDs (src/dst subnets)
- VTI-based IPsec Proxy IDs are typically 0.0.0.0/0 ↔ 0.0.0.0/0 (or a host /32)
- IKE Phase 2 (CHILD_SA) will fail
- But At the protocol level, it is the same protocol

**Why we shouldnt use Crypto maps**

- They cannot natively support MPLS
- Configuration can be complex
- They are commonly misconfigured
- Consume excessive amount of TCAM

### IPSec + VTI + IKEv2 example

`Tunnel` (vrf, bandwidth, ip, mss, mtu, load interval, bfd, source, mode, path mtu discovery, destination, **ipsec profile**) > `ipsec profile` (idle, **transform-set**, pfs group, **ike-v2-profile**) > `ike-v2-profile` (identity, authentication, **keyring**, lifetime, dpd), `transform set`(encryption, hash, mode) > `keyring` (address, key)  
  
`ike-v2-policy` (vrf, **proposals**) > `proposal` (encryption, hash, pfs group)
